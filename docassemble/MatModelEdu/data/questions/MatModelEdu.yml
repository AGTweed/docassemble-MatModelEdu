subquestion: |
  This tool is built on an original concept developed by Alistair McNaught and extended
  with support from AbilityNet.

  You will be asked eight multiple choice questions on where you consider your institution to be on their accessibility journey. At the end we will generate a snapshot report of where you are now and where you can think about going next.
  
  The podcast below explains a bit more, or you can click the continue button underneath to get started!
  
  PLEASE NOTE: Accessibility is crucial to all the work we do. We are aware of some accessibility problems with this tool that we are working to resolve. However, we would still encourage you to [contact us](https://abilitynet.org.uk/how-contact-us) should you experience any difficulties.
